            <li>
              1.5 cups of cooked Jasmine rice cooled
              <i>(or day old rice works well too)</i> - Or just estimate about 1
              normal bowl full
            </li>
            <li>About 5 - 10 shrimp, head peeled, but tail on</li>
            <li>¼ of a big white onion</li>

            </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If you’re using whole fresh shrimp like I did, first pinch off the
              head, and peel the outer shell of the shrimp, leaving only the
              tail on (that’s Thai style). You can also devein them if you’d
              like, but for small shrimp, to me it doesn’t really matter.
            </li>
            <li>Peel 2 cloves of garlic, and then just finely mince them</li>
            <li>Slice ¼ of a sweet white onion into medium sized strips</li>
            <li>Finely dice about 3 - 4 green onions</li>
            <li>
              Take just 1 leaf of Chinese broccoli (kai-lan), slice it in half
              first along the spine, and then slice it into 1 centimeter sized
              strips
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn on your stove to medium high, heat up your wok (or frying
              pan), and add about 1 tablespoon of oil
            </li>
            <li>
              Once your oil is hot, add the garlic first, and stir fry
              continuously for about 15 seconds or so, until it gets nice and
              fragrant
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, toss in your shrimp, and fry for about 30 seconds - your
              shrimp should start to turn pink and feel more firm
            </li>
            <li>
              Add in a little less than ½ of your rice first. This is going to
              soak up all those delicious shrimp juices and oils and keep your
              rice nice and dry. Stir fry for about 10 more seconds - This is a
              little known trick to make good rice, so it remains nice and dry
            </li>
            <li>
              Scoot all your rice to one side of the pan, and then crack in the
              egg into the empty side
            </li>
            <li>
              Whirl the egg up, let it cook for a few seconds, and then start to
              mix it up with the rice and shrimp
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep stir frying for about 20 seconds until the egg is fully
              cooked, and then add in the rest of your rice, and give it a quick
              stir
            </li>
            <li>
              Add ½ tablespoon of soy sauce, ½ tablespoon of oyster sauce, just
              a pinch of sugar (optional), and continue stir frying your rice,
              making sure all the sauce get mixed in
            </li>
            <li>
              Then add your chopped Chinese broccoli and onions, and stir fry
              for another 30 seconds until the vegetables wilt, but they can
              still be crisp and not fully cooked
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, toss in your green onions, stir it a few more seconds, and
              it’s ready
            </li>
            <li>Immediately dish your fried rice onto a plate</li>
            <li>
              Slice off a wedge of lime, and serve it on the plate next to the
              rice
            </li>
            <li>
              For the final touch, I like to sprinkle some freshly ground black
              pepper on top to give some extra flavor
            </li>
