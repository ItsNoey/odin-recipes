          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2
              layers of paper towel to absorb excess water. You want to have as
              little water on the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the
              dressing.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there
              are no more big chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle until it turns into a wet
              paste and all the chunks are dissolved.
            </li>
            <li>Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.</li>
            <li>
              Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up
              slightly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add fish sauce, tamarind juice, and lime juice, adding the
              squeezed lime skin into the mortar as well for extra lime
              fragrance. Stir with a large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip
              method as shown in the

              @8:40. Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes are just
              slightly crushed, it's done!
            </li>
            <li>
              Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts (I forgot to do this
              in the video!).
            </li>
            <li>
              For a truly classic Northeastern Thai meal, serve with sticky rice
              and the ultimate BBQ chicken
